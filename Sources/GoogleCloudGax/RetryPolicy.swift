/// Determines how errors are handled in the retry loop.
///
/// The client libraries automatically retry RPCs when it is safe, that is when:
/// - the RPC failed before any data for the RPC is sent, or
/// - the error is transient **and** the RPC is [idempotent]
///
/// The retry policy determines what errors are transient, and may limit the number of retry attempts.
///
/// The client libraries offer a number of retry policy implementations, including ``AlwaysRetry``,
/// ``Aip194Strict``, and ``NeverRetry``. In addition, the client libraries offer decorators, such
/// as ``LimitedErrorCount`` and ``LimitedElapsedTime`` to constraint the number of retry attempts
/// or the duration of the retry loop.
///
/// Application developers may define their own policies if needed.
///
/// [idempotent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence

  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - state: The state of the retry loop.
  ///   - error: The previous error that caused the retry attempt. Throttling
  ///     only applies to retry attempts, and a retry attempt implies that a
  ///     previous attempt failed. The retry policy should preserve this error.
  /// - Returns: The result of the throttling decision.

  /// - Parameter state: The state of the retry loop.
