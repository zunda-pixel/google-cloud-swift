/// The client libraries automatically poll long-running operations (LROs) until the operation
/// succeeds or fails, or "completes". Sometimes polling the operation may fail, the failure may be
/// a transient problem, something that may be resolved in a future polling attempt, or a
/// unrecoverable error. For example, a `404 - NOT FOUND` status indicates the operation no longer
/// exists, more polling won't resolve the issue, whereas `429 - TOO MANY REQUESTS` indicates a busy
/// service, which may resolve by the next attempt.
///
/// Note that polling errors are distinct from errors in the operation itself. If the operation
/// fails, polling succeeds, and the response indicates the details of the failure.
